# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game using minimax algorithm as well as alpha beta pruning.

Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, Chess, etc.
In Minimax the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.
Every board state has a value associated with it. In a given state if the maximizer has upper hand then, the score of the board will tend to be some positive value. If the minimizer has the upper hand in that board state then it will tend to be some negative value. The values of the board are calculated by some heuristics which are unique for every type of game.

Minimax pseudocode:

def minimax(position,depth,maximizingPlayer):
  if depth==0 or game over in position
  return static evaluation of position
  
  if maximizingPlayer:
    maxEval = -Infinity
    for each child in position:
      eval = minimax(position,depth-1,false)
      maxEval = max(maxEval,eval)
    return maxEval
    
   else:
      minEval = +Infinity
      for each child in position:
        eval = minimax(position,depth-1,true)
        minEval = min(maxEval,eval)
      return minEval
    
    
Alpha-Beta pruning is not actually a new algorithm, rather an optimization technique for minimax algorithm. It reduces the computation time by a huge factor. This allows us to search much faster and even go into deeper levels in the game tree. It cuts off branches in the game tree which need not be searched because there already exists a better move available. It is called Alpha-Beta pruning because it passes 2 extra parameters in the minimax function, namely alpha and beta.
Letâ€™s define the parameters alpha and beta.
Alpha is the best value that the maximizer currently can guarantee at that level or above.
Beta is the best value that the minimizer currently can guarantee at that level or above.


Alpha-Beta pruning pseudocode:

function minimax(node, depth, isMaximizingPlayer, alpha, beta):
  
  if depth==0 or game over in position
  return static evaluation of position
    
   if isMaximizingPlayer :
        bestVal = -INFINITY 
        for each child node :
            value = minimax(node, depth+1, false, alpha, beta)
            bestVal = max( bestVal, value) 
            alpha = max( alpha, bestVal)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return bestVal

   else :
        bestVal = +INFINITY 
        for each child node :
            value = minimax(node, depth+1, true, alpha, beta)
            bestVal = min( bestVal, value) 
            beta = min( beta, bestVal)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return bestVal
